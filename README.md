# Necessities - Bringing Essentials Capabilities to the Sponge Server Environment

<p>Essentials was a very important plugin from the days of Bukkit. It had commands for nearly everything and was "essential" for running a bukkit server. It was so essential to run on a server that 80% of the servers that I had ever been on had implementations of Essentials running on their server in some way or form. However, since Bukkit plugins can not run on Sponge Servers, many of the best servers looking to upgrade to Sponge or 1.8 are left in the dust and instead run on some other Bukkit 1.8 port that allows for Essentials Capabilities.</p>

<p>Well, the real question is: Why Isn't Essentials Supported on Sponge?</p>

<p>And that is why I am here today. To bring Essentials to the modern world.</p>

<h2>Introducing Necessities: Bringing Essentials Capabilities to the Sponge Server Environment</h2>
<p>Necessities is in the very early beta stage of its existence, so stay tuned for updates and early download links in the near future. We have a lot of great ideas regarding implementing Essentials Commands and Features, and are excited to have the chance to bring it over to the latest and greatest Server technology.</p>

<h3>Planned Features</h3>:

<p>Better Teleporting (Warps, P2P Teleporting, Spawn Teleporting (W4W), Homes)</p>
<p>Better Mod Features (TempBan, Jail, Better Kicking, /report, inventory monitoring, sudo commands, asconsole)</p>
<p>Economy (Currency System, ChestShops, /Pay, Trading System)</p>
<p>AFK (Chat Message, Notifications on /tpa, optional god on AFK (permission), afk kick timer)</p>
<p>Better Chat (Chat Colors, Chat Formatting, ~Nick, Broadcast)</p>
<p>Private Messaging (Mail, Private /msg and /r)</p>
<p>Useful shortcuts (/workbench, /enchanting</p>
<p>Other Random Features (/tree, /lightning, better /kill)</p>
<p>PEX Implementations (Based on Sponge Permissions EX Plugin Available Now)</p>
<p>Possible WorldGuard Features (Territory Protection, Would Implement Economy for territory purchase / selling)</p>

<h3>Thank You</h3>

<p>I realize that there inst yet much to show for this plugin yet, but I know that with the help of the community, we have the ability to make Necessities even better than the original. We want Necessities to have all the necessary features for homebrew servers to professional 5000 player servers.</p>
